This list contains the list of CNAME target used by tracking companies disguising their tracker behind first party domains.

See [our article](https://medium.com/nextdns/cname-cloaking-the-dangerous-disguise-of-third-party-trackers-195205dc522a) about ths issue.

This list is not supposed to be used as a general blocklist, but as CNAME blocklist (applied on intermediate CNAMEs as opposed to the query name).
